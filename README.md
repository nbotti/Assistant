# Assistant

A highly extendible C# voice-controlled assistant program. Uses voice recognition to get commands, checks against installed plugins (e.g. "go to google.com" activates the "go to" plugin, which opens the page in the browser). For all other queries, it uses the Wolfram|Alpha API to try and get you an answer.
